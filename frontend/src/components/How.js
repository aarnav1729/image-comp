          The Premier Energies Image Compressor (PEIC) utilizes image processing techniques to significantly reduce the size of your images while maintaining high quality. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it all works:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Image Selection:</strong> Users begin by selecting the images they wish to compress using the upload image box. This ensures ease of use and quick selection of multiple images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>File Upload:</strong> The selected images are uploaded to our server. This step involves transmitting the files securely to ensure user data privacy and integrity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Format Conversion:</strong> Once uploaded, the images are initially converted to PNG format using the <a href="https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharp</a> library. Sharp is a high-performance image processing library that provides fast and efficient conversions, ensuring the images are in a standardized, uncompressed format for further processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lossless Compression:</strong> The converted PNG images are then passed through <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MozJPEG</a>, a JPEG encoder that optimizes compression while maintaining image quality. MozJPEG applies advanced compression algorithms to reduce file size without sacrificing image quality, resulting in significantly smaller images that are virtually indistinguishable from the originals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Throughout the compression process, the file sizes are logged to ensure that the compression meets our high standards. This includes calculating the compression percentage to provide users with clear, quantitative feedback on the effectiveness of the process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Result Display:</strong> The compressed images are displayed on the user's screen along with their original and compressed sizes, and the compression percentage. Users can visually compare the images and download the compressed versions directly.
          </li>
